# Simple python chatbot
A simple Python chat bot.
I am building a simple chatbot that stores its responses in a json file https://github.com/JeremiahNjoroge/Simple-Python-Chatbot/blob/main/bot.json
If the user input is unrecognizable it, returns a random response from https://github.com/JeremiahNjoroge/Simple-Python-Chatbot/blob/main/random_responses.py
The chatbot runs in a Tkinter GUI
NOTE '''The chatbot is not done and I would appreciate any help to make it better'''
